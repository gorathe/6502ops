6502ops
=======

This is a simple single-static HTML file that contains a JSON encoding of
information about the 6502 ISA, as well as additional notes about what the
instructions can do.

All I've done is reorganize the various bits of information on the 'net relating
to the 6502's ISA into something that allows faster retrieval and categorization
of the information, instead of using dead-tree or plaintext.

Most of the information was gleaned
from [6502.org's copy of "NMOS 6502 Opcodes"](6502) by John Pickens, which was
updated by Bruce Clark and by Ed Spittles, and with some additional changes here
and there to make it more readable in HTML.
